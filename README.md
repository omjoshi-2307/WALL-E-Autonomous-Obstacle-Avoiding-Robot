## ⚙️ Working Principle
1. Ultrasonic sensor continuously measures distance from obstacles  
2. Arduino processes sensor data  
3. If an obstacle is detected within threshold distance:  
   - Robot stops  
   - Scans left/right using servo motor  
   - Chooses the safest direction  
   - Motor driver executes movement commands  

This logic enables **fully autonomous collision-free navigation**.
